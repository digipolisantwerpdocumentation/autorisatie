# Autorisatie

## Introductie

The User Management Engine is used to configure the userâ€™s permissions. 

This can only be done for users with an M-Profile (employees) or for system accounts.

Using the Authz or MeAutz service it is possible for an application to request the user's permission.

1. Authz = An API to get users permissions by user id.
2. MeAuthz = An API to get users permissions by OAuth token.
